   <div class="fr2"> <p> <h2> Why are glaciers important?</h2> </p>
 <p>  
    <b> <u> Ice </u> </b> acts like a protective cover over the Earth and our <b><i>oceans</b></i>. These bright white spots reflect excess heat back into space and keep the planet cooler. In theory, the Arctic remains colder than the equator because more of the heat from the sun is reflected off the ice, back into space. </p>

   <p> 
    <b><u>Glaciers</u> </b>around the world can range from ice that is several hundred to several thousand years old and provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time. Through their study, we gain valuable information about the extent to which the planet is rapidly warming. They provide scientists a record of how climate has changed over time. </p>

   <p> 
    Today, about 10% of land area on Earth is covered with glacial ice. Almost 90% is in Antarctica, while the remaining 10% is in the Greenland ice cap. </p>

Rapid glacial melt in Antarctica and Greenland also influences ocean currents, as massive amounts of very cold glacial-melt water entering warmer ocean waters is slowing ocean currents. And as ice on land melts, <u><b> sea levels  </b> </u> will continue to rise.

<h2> Why are glaciers melting?</h2>
 <p>Since the early 1900s, many glaciers around the world have been rapidly melting. Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse <b><i>gas emissions</b></i> have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.</p>

 <p>Even if we significantly <b><i>curb emissions</b></i> in the coming decades, more than a third of the world’s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone. </p>

 <p>Scientists project that if emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice free in the summer as soon as the year 2040 as ocean and air temperatures continue to rise rapidly

 <h3>What can I do to help? </h3>
 <p>Strong action on <b><i>climate change means preparing communities for impacts that are happening now. But it also means looking to the future, focused on reducing the heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere that will bring damaging <i>consequences</i> as our planet warms.</p>
 
<p> The good news is that individuals can play a big part.</p>
 
<p> Reach out to your local elected officials to find out if your city has a disaster response plan for right now. Keeping communities’ safe starts by having a strong plan in place that leverages some of the best, but underutilized tools we have to protect or communities: nature.
